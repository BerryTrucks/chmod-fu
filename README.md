What's chmod-fu?
================
Ever been curios about what those numbers means in a *chmod* command?

Well, wonder no more! Learn and master the art of *chmod-fu*.

With chmod-fu's super easy to use user-interface you can *decipher* those octal values in a blink of an eye. You choose if you want to click on individual bits, such as *read*, *write*, *execute*, or select a pre-defined octal value, both are available to suite your preference.

Some API/technologies used creating this application:

  - Exposing C++ components to QML

  - Translation, supports English and Swedish
